# Predictive Modeling of Annual Inflation Using Weighted Least Squares Regression
## Description
This project involved collaborating with a team to model annual inflation in Asian countries based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) using Weighted Least Squares (WLS) Regression. The primary goal was to analyze the relationship between the CPI and inflation while addressing the issue of non-constant variance in the data, contributing to a deeper understanding of the economic conditions in the region. The dataset was sourced from the World Bank, selecting 20 countries that provided comprehensive data and represented various sub-regions of Asia, including Southeast Asia, East Asia, West Asia, Central Asia, and South Asia.

The project achieved a more accurate prediction model, with performance improvements reflected in the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Residual Standard Error (RSE) values. This work led to recognition as an awardee of the PKMAI incentive at the 2024 Student Creativity Program (PKM) organized by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology (Kemendikbudristek). The findings aim to inform policymakers and stakeholders about inflation trends and economic health across the Asian continent.
